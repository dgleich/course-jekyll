### Office hours
Tentative office hours: Thursday 2:30-4:30pm

Description
-----------

This topics class will probe the intersection and relationship
between problems stated on a network (a graph) 
and their solution, or approximation, via a matrix computation.
 
Selected topics will include

* Spectral graph theory 
* Random walks on graphs  
* Google's PageRank and its many relatives 
(GeneRank, SimRank, IsoRank, ProteinRank, HostRank, TrustRank, BadRank)
* Local algorithms for community detection/graph partitioning 

Prerequisites
-------------

This class is a graduate topics class.  While there are no formal
prerequisites, the class will favor students with additional preparation.
Those without an appropriate background will likely find some of the
material challenging.  Students should be familiar with standard
graph algorithms including shortest paths, spanning trees, etc;
additionally, students should be familiar with standard matrix
computations including solving linear systems, eigenvalue problems,
and optimization problems including least-squares.

Goals and objectives
--------------------

The major goal of this course is to describe network computations,
including modern network analysis procedures and graph algorithms, 
by using the matrix paradigm.  This paradigm simplifies and unifies
the analysis and application of the methods to new data.  Particular
goals are:

* Learn about matrices and semi-rings for solving graph problems
* Learn the theory of Markov chains from a matrix perspective
* Learn about how to analyze and implement the PageRank method in
a general matrix setting
* Learn about spectral graph partitioning, with a focus on local 
algorithms
* Apply this knowledge to research papers from the last 15 years.
* Apply this knowledge on a course project.

Requirements
------------

The formal requirements and percentage of the total course grade are:

* Introductory survey -- 5%  _due August 25th_
* In-class quizzes -- 10%
* Homeworks -- 35%
* Course project -- 40%  
  The anticipated breakdown into parts is:  
  * Proposal 5%, due around the middle of October)   
  * Presentation 5%, final week of classes   
  * Written report 30%, due on December 10.
* Research paper presentation -- 20%


### Quizzes

These will be worth 10% of the total grade and are graded as
taken/missed.  Students can miss up to 5 quizzes with no penalty.
Make sure you contact the instructor if you anticipate missing
more than 5 quizzes due to any planned absenses.

References
----------

There is no required text book.  Instead, the course will proceed
based on research papers as well as class notes.

Policies
--------

### Conduct

Students are expected to maintain a professional and respectful
classroom environment.  In particular, this includes:

* silencing personal electronics
* arriving on time and remaining throughout the class

You may use any non-disruptive personal electronics during class.
_One exception is during in-class quizzes, for which personal
electronics are prohibited._

### Correspondence

Please feel free to email me with any questions, but
please prefix all email titles with the string `CS-59000 NMC:`
to aid in filtering email.

I will make every effort to respond promptly, however, replies could
be delayed due to circumstances outside of my control.  In particular,
do not rely on a response between the hours of 8pm and 8am.  

Please do not attempt to call, google chat, skype, facebook, or tweet with
me without prior arrangement.

### Assignment clarity

I expect all assignments to be legible and well-written.  For this, 
I will suggest using a computer with LaTeX 
to prepare all submitted materials.

*If you do not plan to use a computer and LaTeX
to prepare solutions to homeworks, you must let me know.*

### Missing or late work

Except as discussed below, and or by prior arrangement, missing or late work
will be counted as a zero.

### Collaboration 

Collaboration on homework is allowed.  The final assignments must 
contain a list of all collaborators.  However, students must
prepare solutions individually.  As an example of the ideal
scenario, the following situation is permissible:

> A group of students meets to develop the solution to a problem on
> a white board.  Each student records individual notes from this 
> problem solving meeting.  All students then prepare solutions
> individually and without further collaboration.  These solutions
> show the names of all members in the initial group.

Examples of collaborations that are not allowed include, but are
not limited to:

* Sharing pieces of any written solution
* Sharing source code or any other computer programs
* Reviewing final written solutions

Collaboration on the projects must be discussed with the instructor.

### Computer codes

The assignments will involve producing computer codes.  These need
to be documented and written in accordance with best software engineering 
practices.  Failure to follow this advice may result in solutions receiving
zero points.  Moreover, these should be prepared individually.
Groups may discuss implementation strategies, algorithms, and approaches;
but codes, like written homework solutions, must be prepared separately.

### Grading

The anticipated grade ranges are:

* A -- 85-100%
* B -- 65-85%
* C -- 50-65%
* D -- 40-50%
* F -- 0-40%

These may be adjusted downward by up to 10% to achieve a reasonable
grade distribution.  They also may be minor upward adjustments.

### Dishonesty

Behavior consistent with cheating, copying, and academic dishonesty
is not tolerated.  Depending on the severity, this may result in
a zero score on the assignment, and could result in a failing grade
for the class.

Purdue prohibits "dishonesty in connection with any University 
activity. Cheating, plagiarism, or knowingly furnishing false 
information to the University are examples of dishonesty." (Part 5, 
Section III-B-2-a, University Regulations) Furthermore, the 
University Senate has stipulated that "the commitment of acts of 
cheating, lying, and deceit in any of their diverse forms (such as 
the use of substitutes for taking examinations, the use of illegal 
cribs, plagiarism, and copying during examinations) is dishonest and 
must not be tolerated. Moreover, knowingly to aid and abet, directly 
or indirectly, other parties in committing dishonest acts is in 
itself dishonest." (University Senate Document 72-18, December 15, 
1972)

Please review the 
[Purdue's guide to academic integrity](http://www.purdue.edu/odos/aboutodos/academicintegrity.php)

### Attendance

Students are expected to be present for every meeting of the classes 
in which they are enrolled. Only the instructor can excuse a student 
from a course requirement or responsibility. When conflicts or 
absences can be anticipated, such as for many University sponsored 
activities and religious observations, the student should inform the 
instructor of the situation as far in advance as possible. For 
unanticipated or emergency absences when advance notification to an 
instructor is not possible, the student should contact the 
instructor as soon as possible by email, or by contacting the main 
office that offers the course. When the student is unable to make 
direct contact with the instructor and is unable to leave word with 
the instructor's department because of circumstances beyond the 
student's control, and in cases of bereavement, the student or the 
student's representative should contact the Office of the Dean of 
Students.

### Grief Absence Policy

Purdue University recognizes that a time of bereavement is very 
difficult for a student. The University therefore provides the 
following rights to students facing the loss of a family member 
through the Grief Absence Policy for Students (GAPS). GAPS Policy: 
Students will be excused for funeral leave and given the opportunity 
to earn equivalent credit and to demonstrate evidence of meeting the 
learning outcomes for misses assignments or assessments in the event 
of the death of a member of the student's family.

### Violent Behavior Policy

Purdue University is committed to providing a safe and secure campus 
environment for members of the university community. Purdue strives 
to create an educational environment for students and a work 
environment for employees that promote educational and career goals. 
Violent Behavior impedes such goals. Therefore, Violent Behavior is 
prohibited in or on any University Facility or while participating 
in any university activity.

### Students with Disabilities

Purdue University is required to respond to the needs of the 
students with disabilities as outlined in both the Rehabilitation 
Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 through 
the provision of auxiliary aids and services that allow a student 
with a disability to fully access and participate in the programs, 
services, and activities at Purdue University.
If you have a disability that requires special academic 
accommodation, please make an appointment to speak with me within 
the first three (3) weeks of the semester in order to discuss any 
adjustments.  It is important that we talk about this at the 
beginning of the semester.  It is the student's responsibility to 
notify the Disability Resource Center (http://www.purdue.edu/drc) of 
an impairment/condition that may require accommodations and/or 
classroom modifications.  

### Emergencies

In the event of a major campus emergency, course requirements, 
deadlines and grading percentages are subject to changes that may be 
necessitated by a revised semester calendar or other circumstances 
beyond the instructor’s control. Relevant changes to this course 
will be posted onto the course website or can be obtained by 
contacting the instructors or TAs via email.  You are 
expected to read your @purdue.edu email on a frequent basis.

### Nondiscrimination 

Purdue University is committed to maintaining a community which 
recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every 
person; fosters tolerance, sensitivity, understanding, and mutual 
respect among its members; and encourages each individual to strive 
to reach his or her own potential. In pursuit of its goal of 
academic excellence, the University seeks to develop and nurture 
diversity. The University believes that diversity among its many 
members strengthens the institution, stimulates creativity, promotes 
the exchange of ideas, and enriches campus life.

Purdue University prohibits discrimination against any member of the 
University community on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, 
age, national origin or ancestry, marital status, parental status, 
sexual orientation, disability, or status as a veteran. The 
University will conduct its programs, services and activities 
consistent with applicable federal, state and local laws, 
regulations and orders and in conformance with the procedures and 
limitations as set forth in 
[Executive Memorandum No. D-1](http://www.purdue.edu/policies/pages/human_resources/d_1.html),
which provides specific contractual rights and remedies.
