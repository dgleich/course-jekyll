The intial survey is due August 25th.


Abstract
--------
This topics class will probe the intersection and relationship
between problems stated on a network (a graph) 
and their solution, or approximation, via a matrix computation.
 
Selected topics will include

* Spectral graph theory 
* Random walks on graphs  
* Google's PageRank and its many relatives 
(GeneRank, SimRank, IsoRank, ProteinRank, HostRank, TrustRank, BadRank)
* Network alignment 
* Local algorithms for community detection/graph partitiong 
 

This class will require familiarity with basic network algorithms
(e.g. Dijkstra's shortest paths) as well as linear algebra 
(e.g. linear systems, eigenvalues and eigenvectors) and probability
(Markov chains).
 
 
### Books and reading materials 

The following book is highly recommended.  I'm currently searching for other books
that may be useful as well.   

* Network Analysis, Methodological Foundations.  Ulrik Brandes and Thomas Erlebach (Eds.)
This should be available from the following doi: 
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/b106453>

 
### More details coming soon...
Please email dgleich--a-t--purdue.edu me for details!

This class will most likely involve reading, discussing, and presenting
research papers.  It will also likely involve a project.</p>
